\part{Introduction}
In order to test our platform we provide the following documents:
\begin{itemize}
\item Requirements and analysis specification document (RASD)
\item Design Document (DD)
\item Source Code
\end{itemize}

\part{Test cases}
The following test cases address the key functionalities of the MeteoCal platform.

\section{User registration}
\begin{tabular}{| p{0.2\linewidth} | p{0.8\linewidth} |}

\part{Note on the automated tests}
The automated tests can perform a huge number of queries to the OpenWeatherMap service, therefore it is possible that sometimes they occasionally fail (OpenWeatherMap grants a limited number of query per minute). This is not a problem as the tests will start again to work of you wait some time.
